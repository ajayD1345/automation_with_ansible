Composer plugins have been disabled for safety in this non-interactive session.
Set COMPOSER_ALLOW_SUPERUSER=1 if you want to allow plugins to run as root/super user.
Do not run Composer as root/super user! See https://getcomposer.org/root for details
Composer is operating significantly slower than normal because you do not have the PHP curl extension enabled.
No composer.lock file present. Updating dependencies to latest instead of installing from lock file. See https://getcomposer.org/install for more information.

Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires php ^8.2 but your php version (7.4.33) does not satisfy that requirement.
  Problem 2
    - Root composer.json requires laravel/pint ^1.13 -> satisfiable by laravel/pint[v1.13.0, ..., v1.15.0].
    - laravel/pint[v1.13.0, ..., v1.15.0] require php ^8.1.0 -> your php version (7.4.33) does not satisfy that requirement.
  Problem 3
    - Root composer.json requires phpunit/phpunit ^11.0 -> satisfiable by phpunit/phpunit[11.0.0, ..., 11.0.8].
    - phpunit/phpunit[11.0.0, ..., 11.0.8] require php >=8.2 -> your php version (7.4.33) does not satisfy that requirement.
  Problem 4
    - Root composer.json requires spatie/laravel-ignition ^2.4 -> satisfiable by spatie/laravel-ignition[2.4.0, 2.4.1, 2.4.2].
    - spatie/laravel-ignition[2.4.0, ..., 2.4.2] require php ^8.1 -> your php version (7.4.33) does not satisfy that requirement.
  Problem 5
    - laravel/framework[v11.0.0, ..., v11.1.0] require php ^8.2 -> your php version (7.4.33) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - Root composer.json requires laravel/framework ^11.0 -> satisfiable by laravel/framework[v11.0.0, ..., v11.1.0].

Running update with --no-dev does not mean require-dev is ignored, it just means the packages will not be installed. If dev requirements are blocking the update you have to resolve those problems.
